Retropad Controller Overlay made for the Retroarch Emulation Frontend

Designed for and tested on Galaxy Z Fold 4

Made using RetroPad Editor - https://valent-in.github.io/retropad-editor/




BUTTONS:

D Pad/Analog Stick - 4 Face Buttons - L1 - R1 - Start - Select - Retroarch Menu - Analog/Digital Toggle - Rotate





SUMMARY:

Test overlay controller that uses the portrait mode while open and landscape mode while closed. Ideally this offers optimal use of the screen real estate when emulating games

No L2 or R2 functionality (This is for my specific use case)

The Analog/Digital Toggle swaps the D-Pad directly with the Analog Stick, does not add or realign anything

The second overlay button may is there for possible future use






PORTRAIT MODE

Meant exclusively for when the device is open

Controls aligned to bottom of the screen, far down enough to accomodate the GB and GBC 10:9 aspect ratio

D-Pad and Face Buttons are closer to the middle, so thumbs can rest on controls rather than bend to operate

Other buttons mapped along the reach of the thumbs, with config buttons in bottom corners out of the way






LANDSCAPE MODE

Meant exclusively for when the device is closed

Controls aligned to the sides, far enough to accomodate the GBA 3:2 aspect ratio

D-Pad and Face Buttons are at the top, to compensate for the more narrow screen

L and R buttons are below the Face and D-Pad, Config buttons out of the way of accidental palm touch







Might add 6 Button mode in the future
